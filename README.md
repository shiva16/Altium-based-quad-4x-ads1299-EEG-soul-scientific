This is an open sourced brain electrophysiology amplifier. This is a texas instrument's Ads1299 which is an age old eeg amplifier, this board if fully programable withh openeeg 's firmware. The pin and device numbers of the additional amplifiers must alone be added to the

This is completely intended for a community development from a neuroscience student who's hobby happens to be embedded electronics and hardware development. Would appriciate contributions that you want me to add.
